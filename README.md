###Outline
This assignment is intended to get you to understand viewing in 3D, how to input and edit a parametric curve, and build a cylinder around the curve.

###Requirements
1. Start with building a viewing interface for a simple cube.
2. Add viewports to look at 2D orthographic views of your scene for input of a parametric curve control points.
3. Input points directly into the perspective viewport (conversion from 2D to 3D is necessary)
4. Build a user editable Catmul Rom spline through the input points.
5. Calculate Frenet frames at regular intervals.
6. Add a cube at each frame origin to show that the Frenet frames are orientated correctly.
7. Calculate polygon cross sections at each frame and connect them up into a cylinder. You can use the viewing interface to move the camera around the parametric curve.
